## Steps to integrate the API
To integrate the ChatGPT API into a Flutter app, follow these steps:

- Get an API key: An API key will be required to access the ChatGPT API. You can sign up for an API key on the ChatGPT website.
- Integrate the chatGPT server with the Flutter app: You can use Flutter's HTTP client to make API requests to the backend server and receive responses.
- Display responses in the chat UI: Once the response is received from the ChatGPT API, we will display it in the chat UI of the Flutter app.

## ChatGPT API

The ChatGPT Chat Completion API is a service provided by OpenAI that allows developers to integrate ChatGPT's conversational AI capabilities into their own applications, websites, or services. 
Essentially, this API gives you access to ChatGPT's ability to generate text-based responses in a conversational manner, leveraging the model's extensive training data to produce replies that can range from informative and helpful to creative and entertaining.
